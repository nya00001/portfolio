To start, I had to research and review the IMDAC and in-class demos, as well as some external resources, and then I started building the actual pages by organizing each section. The process was fairly straightforward, but I encountered difficulties matching one section of the home page to the design I made in the user experience class using only Bootstrap. After many attempts, I was able to fix it with a combination of Bootstrap and custom CSS. I learned to pay extra attention to the design phase and keep the coding side in mind as I worked on designing the layout. and to keep it simple. I discovered that using Bootstrap cuts the workload in half, and since this is my first website to use it, I will be practicing more and more in my break.
